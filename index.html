  <h1>Exploring the Original Scriptures</h1>

  <p>
    This project is dedicated to investigating what the Bible really says — from its roots in Judaism through early Christianity — by looking at the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many modern doctrines about Hell, God’s character, and the end times are based on mistranslations, church politics, or cultural reinterpretations. Here, we go back to the source.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To distinguish <strong>Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, Lake of Fire</strong>, and other concepts improperly merged into "Hell"</li>
    <li>To understand the original meanings of <strong>repentance, judgment, mercy, and salvation</strong></li>
    <li>To shed light on how early Christian thought emerged from Jewish beliefs</li>
    <li>To explore the true character of God across scripture without distortion</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Upcoming Topics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sheol vs. Hades:</strong> Peaceful sleep or fiery torment?</li>
    <li><strong>Gehenna:</strong> Real place or metaphor?</li>
    <li><strong>The Lake of Fire:</strong> Final death or eternal torture?</li>
    <li><strong>How Christianity Changed from Judaism:</strong> Doctrinal shifts</li>
    <li><strong>God’s Nature in Hebrew:</strong> Chesed, Emunah, Ruach</li>
  </ul>

    “The Hebrew Bible is not silent about the afterlife. But what it says is very different from what most modern people think.”
